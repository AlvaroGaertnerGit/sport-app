// ceilings, not just intent. Nothing here should ever need "toning down"
// later — if a future mood needs bigger numbers than these, that's a sign
// it's not one of Scope's five canonical moods.
//
// For curious/thinking/observe these are the literal animate target (see
// use-scope-motion.ts). idle and happy each animate their own keyframe
// array below instead — for those two, scale/rotate/y here are a nominal
// reference point (idle's resting baseline; happy's peak) for the debug
// panel to display, not a value Framer ever animates to directly. Keep
// them in sync with SCOPE_IDLE_ANIMATE / SCOPE_HAPPY_ANIMATE below if

// always literally animated" caveat as scale/rotate/y applies to idle and
// happy here — see SCOPE_HAPPY_EYE_ANIMATE below for happy's real target.
