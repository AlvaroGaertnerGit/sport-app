// Scope's autonomous idle-gesture vocabulary — deliberately NOT a 6th mood.
// scope-motion.ts's SCOPE_MOODS is a closed set of five (idle, curious,
// thinking, observe, happy); every gesture here is a small, transient
// deviation layered on top of whichever of those five is currently active
// (in practice, only ever "idle" — see use-scope-personality.ts), never a
// replacement for it.
//
// SPR-003.3 (character finalization, VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md v2.0's Eye
// Behaviour + Idle Behaviour lists): this roster grew substantially —
// body gestures (glance/tilt/posture, plus new stretch/bounce), true eye
// blinks (a real scaleY close-open, not the old opacity-based
// "focus-pulse," which is retired), eye squint/widen, eye look-up/down,
// eye convergence, and one antenna-flex gesture. A large, varied pool is
// deliberate — it's what "vary naturally, never loop identically" (the
// docs' own words) actually requires; the scheduler in
// use-scope-personality.ts still only ever fires ONE per idle window.
//
// "glance" and "look around" (body gestures) are deliberately NOT eye
// movement — they're a tiny whole-body rotate/y nudge, the same way Luxo
// Jr. looks somewhere by moving, not by animating eyes. The eye-specific
// look/converge gestures below are a DIFFERENT, smaller channel
// (eyeOffset/eyeConverge) that VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md v2.0 now explicitly
// asks for ("looking left/right/up/down," "slight eye convergence") —
// this is a deliberate expansion, not a contradiction: body gestures move
// the whole creature, eye gestures move only the gaze, and neither one
// touches presence's own eyeX/eyeY (cursor-tracking), which compose with
// these via addition at the scope.tsx composition point.
