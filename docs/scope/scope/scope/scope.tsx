// Scope — the portfolio's companion. Canonical source of truth (SPR-003.3,
// "Character Finalization"): docs/scope-docs/scope/SCOPE.md and
// VISUAL_LANGUAGE.md (both v2.0), plus the reference image at
// docs/scope-docs/scope/references/image.png. Read those before changing
// anything about Scope's identity.
//
// A client component now that it animates — see the performance skill's
// "extract the interactive piece into its own client leaf" guidance; the
// Hero and every other place Scope is mounted stay Server Components.
//
// Deliberately a pure function of `mood`: no callback props, no internal
// mood state. Whoever controls mood (the /scope lab page today, other
// placements later) owns any lifecycle logic — e.g. "happy" resolving
// itself back to "idle" — see SCOPE_HAPPY_HOLD_MS in scope-motion.ts.
//
// Three independent layers compose here, each owning a different concern
// (Motion: how mood animates; Presence: cursor interaction; Personality:
// autonomous idle behaviour) — none of the three hooks knows about the
// other two; this component is the one place they're combined:
//
// - Mood (useScopeMotion) drives the body's `animate` (scale/rotate/y —
//   the idle breathing loop keeps running underneath) and each eye's
//   resting `scaleY` expression (`eyeScaleY`).
// - Presence (useScopePresence) drives cursor-derived `style` values:
//   body tilt (rotateX/rotateY), the eyes' gaze position (eyeX/eyeY, plus
//   a tiny always-on jitter baked in), the antenna's reactive sway
//   (antennaRotate), and the accent dot's proximity-based visibility
//   (interactionIntensity).
// - Personality (useScopePersonality) drives occasional idle gestures:
//   rotate/y/scale on the body, blinkScaleY on the eyes (multiplicative
//   with mood's own eyeScaleY — see the nested <motion.g> below, not a
//   useTransform combinator, since mood's eyeScaleY isn't a MotionValue),
//   eyeOffsetX/Y and eyeConverge on the eyes' gaze (additive with
//   presence's eyeX/eyeY), and antennaFlex on the antenna. SPR-005:
//   Personality also takes this component's own `ref` plus the optional
//   `attentionTarget` prop below, so it can occasionally aim eyeOffsetX/Y
//   at a registered point of interest (a project world's ball/graph
//   marker) instead of a scripted offset — still the same eyeOffsetX/Y
//   channel, no new composition wiring needed here. SPR-011: Personality
//   also exposes `touch()`, wired to onClick on the shell/display shapes
//   below — the "trust" interaction (notice → suppressed bounce → full
//   stretch across repeated touches) plays over these exact same
//   rotate/y/scale/blinkScaleY/antennaFlex channels, so nothing here
//   composes any differently whether a reaction came from the autonomous
//   scheduler or a direct touch.
//
// Framer merges every transform-shaped style key (x, y, rotate, rotateX,
// rotateY, scale, scaleY, ...) on one style object into a single CSS
// transform automatically, so values from different hooks compose for
// free as long as they don't share a key name; where two independent
// values need to affect the *same* property (eye position, eye scaleY),
// they're combined explicitly below via useTransform (additive) or nested
// elements (multiplicative) — see the comments at each call site for why
// one technique was used over the other.
